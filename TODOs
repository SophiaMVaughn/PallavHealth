UPDATE -- Google doc with ideal hire/what we need
       -- put in google doc about making the forum safe *NLP *what are the safety measures?
	   --how to convert the med lingo into user friendly language with NLP?



	This week
#don't send the password through get
##make a joinURL field on createpg AND the mtg detail page <------------------0
#check how the usernames are made (no spaces/unicode --> regex?)
#TODO -- FIX TIME ZONE MANAGEMENT (it is registering all time stamps as 4hrs in the future)
    #even the time creation is wrong but it is still seeing the time zone as EST so ??????
#TODO figure out how to display an error message while they're entering the form data
#encrypt - names and passwords
#**disable the create acct button if there is an error on the form? (possible???)

	
	This month
#page out the patient print out (20/pg)
#make an autocomplete for patient appt create somehow (having 100+ usernames, a dropdown is not viable)
	#make a search functionality for when the doctor is adding patients to the appt
	#can use binary search bc we will have it sorted
#SOLVE LATENCY ***
	#think of ways to reduce aws queries
	-keep a list of patient on the backend (only query for it once on log in bc it won't change while the dr is logged in)
	-make query for appts better/more efficient?
	-keep list of current appts (like patients)? (how to deal with dr making an appt while patient is logged in?)
#SEND THE USER AN EMAIL (not confirmation, just notification of being added to an appt/delete and acct udated) 
	#NOT MARKED AS SPAMMMM
#make week/day view version of the calendar

	Eventually
Make a notification system (notify patients when a dr invites them to an appt)
##email validation? (valid domain at least)
##look into dynamic text boxes (react to user input AS THEY TYPE -- do not need to submit)
###validation of zoom acct on creation??? Not possible
##TODO -- radio buttons for recurring meetings (how to line up recurring mtgs)
###form integration
###how to make Zoom doctor sub users under the main admin acct -- are they in the secret/encrypted in the JWT key??
	#####will the same key have the ability to query all of the sub users+CRUD their meetings?
	###-- how to get the meetings that the patients have been invited to without them being owners of the JWT app/not being encrypted in the key?
#(eventually) make doctor users only able to be created after approval by admins
#(eventually) validate acct (through email) - confirmation
#(eventually) forgot password/recover acct
